Below represents some stuff how laboratory 6 works:


To create and delete databases we use DB.py

For start or finish work for someone we use emplr.by, also it is used for create/delete worker and at the end for 
create the report. After pressing button "Exit" Terminal will be closed and report done.

For check ID_Card of someone we use issuer.py, here is connected time for workers.

Report.csv the file where is everything written about worker.

Records.db there are located Tables with connection to DB

seedr.py this is generator for random employeers.


User_Id could be as the special number which we assign, otherwise "Not Given".

Raspberry Pi is located in issuer.py  (Terminal A)

Connection to localhost with our broker in emplr.py (Terminal B)

The system is working when both Terminals are connected in the same time.
